	A fraction\index{fraction} is a different way of writing a divison. In a fraction the dividend is called the \textit{numerator}\index{numerator} and the divisor the denominator\index{denominator}.

Common ways of saying $ \frac{1}{4} $ are\footnote{We also have the expressions from the Language Box on page \pageref{sprakdiv}.}
\begin{itemize}
	\item ''one fourth''
	\item ''1 of 4''
	\item ''1 over 4''
\end{itemize}
}
\subsubsection{Brøk som mengde}
Let us present $ \frac{1}{4} $ as a figure. We then think of the number 1 as a \\box\footnote{For practical reasons we choose a one-box larger than the one used in \hrs{Talavare}{Kapittel}.}: 
\begin{figure}[hbt]
	\centering
	\includegraphics{\asym{br1}}
\end{figure}
\newpage
Further on we divide this box into four smaller equal-sized boxes. The sum of these boxes equals 1.
\begin{figure}[hbt]
	\centering
	\includegraphics{\asym{br2}}
\end{figure} 
One such box equals $ \frac{1}{4} $:
\begin{figure}[hbt]
	\centering
	\includegraphics{\asym{br3a}}
\end{figure} 
However, if one from a figure only shall see how large a fraction is, the size of 1 must be known, and to make this more apparent we'll also include the ''empty'' boxes:
\fig{br3}
In this way, the blue and the empty boxes tells us how many pieces 1 is divided into, while
the blue boxes alone tells how many of these boxes wich are \textsl{actually} present. In other words,\regv

\subsubsection{Fractions on the number line}
On the number line we divide the length between 0 and 1 into as many pieces as the denominator indicates. In the case of a fraction with denominator 4, we seperate the length between 0 og 1 into 4 equal lengths:
\fig{br9}
Moreover, fractions larger than 1 are easily presented on the number line:
\fig{br9a}
\subsubsection{Numerator and denominator summarized}
Although already mentioned, the interpretation of the numerator and denominator is of such an importance that we shortly summarize it:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The denominator tells how many pieces 1 is divided into.
	\item The numerator tells how many of these pieces are present.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Fractions with equal value}
Fractions can have the same value even though they look different. If you calculate $ 1:2 $, $ 2:4 $ and $ 4:8 $, you will in all cases end up with 0.5 as the answer. This means that
\alg{
\frac{1}{2}=\frac{2}{4}=\frac{4}{8}=0,5
} \\[5pt]

\fig{br12a}
\subsubsection{Expanding}
The fact that fraction can look different but have the same vaue, implies that we can change a fraction's look without changing its value. Let's as an expample change $ \frac{3}{5} $ into a fraction of equal value but with 10 as its denominator:
\begin{itemize}
	\item We can make $ \frac{3}{5} $ into a fraction with 10 as its denominator if we divide each fifth into 2 equal pieces. In that case, 1 is divided into $ {5\cdot2=10} $ pieces in total.
	\item The numerator of $ \frac{3}{5} $ indicates that there are 3 fifths. When these 3 pieces are divided by 2, they make up $ 3\cdot2=6 $ tenths. Hence $ \frac{3}{5} $ equals $ \frac{6}{10} $.
\end{itemize}
\[ \frac{3}{5}=\frac{3\cdot2}{5\cdot2}=\frac{6}{10} \]
\fig{br13}
\fig{br13a}

\subsubsection{Simplifying}
Note that we can also go ''the opposite way''. We can change $ \frac{6}{10} $ into a fraction with 5 as denominator by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2:
\[ \frac{6}{10}=\frac{6:2}{10:2}=\frac{3}{5} \]

\section{\bradsub}
Addition and subtraction of fractions is in large parts focused around the denominators. Recall that the denominators indicates the partitioning of 1. If fractions have equal denominators, they represent amounts of equal-sized pieces. In this case it makes sense calculating addition or subtraction of the numerators. If fractions have unequal denominators, however, they represent amounts of different-sized pieces, and hence addition and subtraction of the numerators makes no sense directly.
\subsubsection{Equal denominators}
For example, if we have 2 sixths and add 3 sixths, the sum is 5 sixths:
\[ \frac{2}{6}+\frac{3}{6}=\frac{5}{6} \]

\[ \frac{3}{5}-\frac{1}{2} \]
\fig{br7}
\fig{br7t}
To write the difference as a fraction, the two terms needs a common denominator. Both of the fractions can have 10 as its denominator:
\alg{
\frac{3}{5}=\frac{3\cdot2}{5\cdot2}=\frac{6}{10}\qquad\quad\qquad \frac{1}{2}=\frac{1\cdot5}{2\cdot5}=\frac{5}{10}

Hence
\[ \frac{3}{5}-\frac{1}{2}=\frac{6}{10}-\frac{5}{10} \]
\fig{br7a}
\fig{br7ta}
To summarize, we have expanded the fractions such that they have a common denominator, that is 10. When the denominators are equal, we can calculate the difference of the numerators:
\alg{
\frac{3}{5}-\frac{1}{2}&=\frac{6}{10}-\frac{5}{10}\br

By \rref{brhel} we can make an interpretation of multiplying by a fraction. For example, multiplying $ 3 $ by $ \frac{2}{5} $ can be interpreted in these two following ways:
\begin{itemize}
	\item We multiply $ 3 $ by $ 2 $ and divide the product by $ 5 $:
	\[ 3\cdot2=6\quad,\quad 6:5=\frac{6}{5}\]
	\item We divide $ 3 $ by $ 5 $ and multiply the quotient by $ 2 $:
	\[ 3:5=\frac{3}{5} \quad,\quad \frac{3}{5}\cdot2=\frac{3\cdot2}{5}=\frac{6}{5}\]

It is now important to recall two things:

	\item In a fraction it is the numerator which indicates the amount (the denominator indicates the division of 1)

\subsubsection{When the numerator is not divisible by the denominator}
What if we are to divide $ \frac{3}{4} $ by 2? 
\[ \frac{3}{4}:2 \]
\fig{br5}
\fig{br5t}
Thing is that we can always expand the fraction, such that the numerator becomes divisible by the divisor. Since 2 is the divisor, we expand the fraction by 2:
\[ \frac{3}{4}=\frac{3\cdot2}{4\cdot2}=\frac{6}{8} \]
\fig{br5c}
\fig{br5ct}
Now we have 6 eights. 6 eights divided by 2 equals 3 eights:
\fig{br5a}
\fig{br5at}
Hence
\[ \frac{3}{4}:2=\frac{3}{8} \]
In effect, we have multiplied $ \frac{3}{4} $ by 2:
\alg{
\frac{3}{4}:2 &= \frac{3}{4\cdot2} \br
&= \frac{3}{8}

At the start of this section we found that

In that case we did not multiply the denominator by 2, such as \rref{brdeenk} implies. However, if we do that we have 
\alg{
\frac{4}{8}:2=\frac{4}{8\cdot2}=\frac{4}{16}

But
\[ \dfrac{2}{8}=\dfrac{2\cdot2}{8\cdot2}=\dfrac{4}{16} \]
Hence, the two answers are of equal value. Thing is that when dividing a fraction by an integer, and the numerator is divisible by the integer, we can divide the numerator by the integer directly. Therefore, in such cases it is not wrong but neither necessary to apply \rref{brdeenk}.

We have seen that\footnote{Look at the text box with the title \textit{An interpretation of multiplying by a fraction} on page \pageref{brtolk}.} multiplying a fraction by number involves multiplying the number by the numerator and then dividing the product by the denominator. Let us apply this to calculate
\[  {\frac{5}{4}\cdot\frac{3}{2}}\] 
Firstly, we multiply $ \frac{5}{4} $ by 3, then we divide the resulting product by 2. By \rref{brhel}, we have
\alg{
\frac{5}{4}\cdot3 =\frac{5\cdot 3}{4}

When the numerator and the denomerator are of equal value, the fractions value always equals 1. For example, \y{\frac{3}{3}=1}, \y{\frac{25}{25}=1} etc. We can exploit this fact to simplify expressions involving fractions. \vsk

Let us simplify the expression
\[ \frac{8\cdot 5}{9\cdot8} \]
Since $ {8\cdot5}={5\cdot8} $, we can write
\[ \frac{8\cdot5}{9\cdot8}=\frac{5\cdot8}{9\cdot8} \]
And, as recently seen (\rref{brtbr}), we have
\[\frac{5\cdot8}{9\cdot8}= \frac{5}{9}\cdot\frac{8}{8}\]
Since $ {\frac{8}{8}=1} $,
\alg{

When multiplication is exclusively, present in a fraction, we can always shuffle the way we did in the expressions above, however, when you have understood the outcome of the shuffling it is better to apply \textit{cancellation}\index{cancellation}. You then draw a line across two and two equal factors, by this indicating that they constitute a fraction which equals 1. Thus, our most recent example can be simplified as

Let's calculate $ 4:\frac{2}{3}  $. Since the fraction have 3 as its denominator, it could be wise to transform 4 into a fraction which also have $ 3 $ as its denominator.
\[ 4=\dfrac{12}{3} \]

\begin{center}
	''The number of $ \frac{2}{3}$'s added to make 4.''

We can't study the number line every time we are to divide by a fraction, so here we shall find a general method, again with $ 4:\frac{2}{3} $ as our example. Then we apply this interpretation of divison:
\begin{center}
	$  4:\dfrac{2}{3}= $ ''The number to multiply $ \frac{2}{3} $ by to make 4.''
\end{center}
We begin the search of this number by multiplying $ \frac{2}{3} $ by the number which results in the product equal to 1. This number is the \textit{inverted fraction}\index{fraction!inverted} of $ \frac{2}{3} $, which is $ \frac{3}{2} $:
\[ \frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{3}{2}=1 \]
Now we only have to multiply by 4 to make 4:
