\subsection*{Addition with amounts}
When we have an amount and wish to add more, we use the symbol \sym{$ + $}. If we have 2 and want to add 3, we write
\[ 2+3=5 \]
\fig{plusm1}
The order in which we add have no impact on the results; starting off with 2 and adding 3 is the same as starting off with 3 and adding 2:
\[ 3+2=5 \]

	A calculation involving addition includes two or more \textit{terms}\index{term} and one \textit{sum}\index{sum}. In the calculation
	\[ 2+3=5 \]
	both $ 2 $ and $ 3 $ are terms while $ 5 $ is the sum.\vsk
	
	Common ways of saying $ 2+3 $ include
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ''2 plus 3''
		\item ''2 added to 3''
	 	\item ''2 and 3 added''
	\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Addition on the number line: moving to the right}
On a number line, addition with positive numbers involves moving \textsl{to \\the right}:\regv

\info{Interpretation of \sym{$\bm=$}}{
\sym{+} brings the possibility of expressing numbers in different ways, for example is $ {5=2+3} $ and $ {5=1+4} $. In this context, \sym{=} means ''has the same value as''. This is also the case regarding subtraction, multiplication and division which we'll look at in the next three sections.
