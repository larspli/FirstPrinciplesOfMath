\sym{:} is the symbol for division.

\spr{ \label{sprakdiv}
A calculation involving division includes a \textit{dividend}\index{dividend}, a \textit{divisor}\index{divisor} and a \textit{quotient}\index{quotient}.	
In the calculation
\[  {12:3=4} \]
$ 12 $ is the dividend, $ 3 $ is the divisor and $ 4 $ is the quotient.\vsk

Common ways of saying $ 12:3 $ include
\begin{itemize}
	\item ''12 divided by 3''
	\item ''12 to 3''
\end{itemize}
In a lot of contexts, \sym{$ / $} is used instead of \sym{$:$}, especially in computer programming. \vsk

Sometimes $ {12:3} $ is called ''the \textit{ratio}\index{ratio} of 12 to 3''. \vsk

\subsection*{Distribution of amounts}
The calculation $ {12:3} $ tells that we shall distribute 12 into 3 equal groups:
\fig{del1}
We observe that each group contains 4 boxes, which means that
\[ 12:3=4 \]


\subsection*{Number of equal terms}
	\fig{del2}
12 equals the sum of 4 instances of 3, that is $ 12:3=4 $.


\subsection*{The inverse operation of multiplication}
We have just seen that if we divide 12 into 3 equal groups, we get 4 in each group. Hence $ 12:3=4$. The sum of these groups makes 12: 
\fig{del1b}
However, this is the same as multiplying 4 by 3, in other words:
If we know that $ {4\cdot 3=12} $, we also know that $ {12:3=4} $. As well we know that $ {12:4=3} $.
