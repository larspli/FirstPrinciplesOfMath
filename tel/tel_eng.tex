\section{The equal sign, amounts, and number lines}
\index{tal}
\subsection*{The equal sign}
As the name implies, the \textit{equal sign} \index{equal sign} \sym{$ = $} refers to things that are the same. In what sense some things are the same is a philosophical question and initially we are bound to this: What equality \sym{$=$} points to must be understood by the context in which the sign is used. With this understanding of \sym{=} we can study some basic properties of our numbers and then later return to more precise meanings of the sign. \regv
\spr{
Common ways of expressing \sym{$=$} is
\begin{itemize}
	\item ''equals'' \\
	\item ''is the same as''
\end{itemize}
}
\subsection*{Amounts and number lines}
There are many ways a number can be defined, however, in this book we shall stick to two ways of interpreting a number; a number as an \textsl{amount} and a number as a \textsl{placement on a line}. All representations of numbers rely on the understanding of 0 and 1.

\subsubsection*{Numbers as amounts}
	Talking about an amount, the number 0 is\footnote{In \refkap{Rekneartane} we'll see that there are other interpretations of 0.} connected to ''nothing''. A figure showing nothing will therefore equal 0:
	\[ =0 \]
	1 we'll draw like a box:
	\fig{rut1}
In this way, other numbers are defined by how many one-boxes (ones/units) we have:
	\fig{rut2}
\newpage	
\subsubsection*{Numbers as placements on a line}
	When placing numbers on a line, 0 is our starting point:
	\fig{lin0a}
	Now we place 1 a set length to the right of 0:
	\fig{lin0b}
	Other numbers are now defined by how many one-lengths (ones/units) we are away from 0:
	\fig{lin1}
\subsection*{Positive integers}
We'll soon see that numbers do not necessarily have to be a \textsl{whole} amount of ones, but those which \textsl{are} have their own name:\regv

\reg[Positive integers]{
Numbers which are a whole amount of ones are called \\\textit{positive\footnotemark integers}\index{positive integers}. The positive integers are
\[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \text{ and so on.} \]
Positive integers are also called \textit{natural numbers}\index{number!natural}.
}
\info{What about 0?}{
Some authors also include 0 in the definition of natural\\ numbers. This is in some cases beneficial, in others not.
}
\footnotetext{We'll see what the word \textit{positiv}e refers to in chapter \hrs{Negtal}{chapter}.}

\newpage
\section{Numbers, digits and value}
Our numbers consist of the \textit{digits}\index{digits} $ 0, 1, 2 , 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 $ and $ 9 $ along with their \textsl{positions}. The digits and their positions defines\footnote{Later on, we'll also see that \textit{signs} have an impact on a numbers value  (see \refkap{Negtal}).} the \textit{value} \index{value} of numbers.
\subsection*{Integers larger then 10}
Let's, as an example, write the number \textsl{fourteen} by our digits.
\fig{tel_eng}
We can now make a group of 10 ones, then we also have 4 ones. By this, we write fourteen as
\[ \text{fourteen}=14 \]
\fig{tel2_eng}\vsk

\fig{tel2t}
\newpage
\subsection*{Decimal numbers}
Sometimes we don't have a whole amount of ones, and this brings about the need to divide ''ones'' into smaller pieces. Let's start off by drawing a one:
\fig{maal}
\fig{des1}
Now we divide our one into 10 smaller pieces:
\fig{maal1}
\fig{des1a}
Since we have divided 1 into 10 pieces, we name one such piece \textit{a tenth}:
\fig{maal1a_eng}
\fig{des1b_eng}
\begin{comment}
\eks{\vs
	\fig{maal2}
	\fig{des2}
}\vsk
\end{comment}
We indicate tenths by using the \textit{decimal mark}: \sym{.}  
\fig{maal1b_eng}
\fig{des1c_eng}

	\fig{maal2a_eng}
	\fig{des3_eng}

\spr{
In a lot of countries, a comma is used in place of the period for the decimal mark.\vsb

\newpage
\subsection*{Base-10 positional notation}
So far, we have seen how we can express the value of a number by placing digits according to the amount of tens, ones and tenths. The pattern continues: \regv

\reg[Base-10 positional notation \label{titalsys}]{
The value of a number is given by the digits $ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8  $ and $ 9 $ and their position. In respect to the digit indicating ones, 
\begin{itemize}
	\item digits to the left indicate amounts of tens, hundreds,\\ thousands etc.
	\item digits to the left indicate amounts of tenths, hundredths,\\ thousandths etc.
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\reg[Even and odd numbers \label{parogodd}]{
	Inegers with 0, 2, 6 or 8 on the ones place are called \textit{even numbers} \index{numbers!even}.\vsk
	
	Integers with 1, 3, 5, 7 or 9 on the ones place are called \textit{odd numbers} \index{numbers!odd}.
}
\eks{
	The first ten (positive) even numbers are
	\[ \text{0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, og 18} \]
	The first ten (positive) odd numbers are
	\[ \text{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, og 19} \]
}

\section{Coordinate systems \label{Koord}}

\prbxl{0.5}{Two number lines can be put together to form a \textit{coordinate system}\index{coordinate system}. In that case we place one number line \textsl{horizontally} and one \textsl{vertically}. A position in a coordinate system is called a  \textit{point}\index{point}. 
 }\qquad
\prbxr{0.4}{In fact, there are many types of coordinate systems, but we'll use the \textit{cartesian coordinate system}. It is named after the French mathematician and philosopher, Ren√© Descartes.}
\st{A point is written as two numbers inside a bracket. We shall call\\ these two numbers the \textit{first coordinate} and the \textit{second \\coordinate}.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The first coordinate tells how many units to move along the horizontal axis.
		\item The second coordinate tells how many units to move along the vertical axis.
\end{itemize}
In the figure, the points $ (2, 3) $, $ (5, 1) $ and $ (0, 0) $ are shown. The point where the axes intersect, $ (0, 0) $, is called \textit{origo}.
