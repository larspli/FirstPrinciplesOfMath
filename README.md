<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This book introduces the fundations of mathematics. 

### Built With

* [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)
* [Asymptote](https://asymptote.sourceforge.io/)
* [TeX Studio](https://www.texstudio.org/)


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This space includes the complete file structure of the book, ready to be compiled in a TeX-editor. The main documents are

- G.tex (the book in Norwegian)
- G_bm.tex (the book in alternative Norwegian)
- G_eng.tex (the book in English)

Building and compiling these files cunstructs the PDF versions of the book:
- [Matematikken sine byggesteinar (Norwegian, nynorsk)](https://github.com/sindrsh/FirstPrinciplesOfMath/blob/master/G.pdf)
- [Matematikkens byggesteiner (Norwegian, bokm√•l)](https://github.com/sindrsh/FirstPrinciplesOfMath/blob/master/G_bm.pdf)
- [First Principles of Math (English)](https://github.com/sindrsh/FirstPrinciplesOfMath/blob/master/G_eng.pdf)  

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
My personal target is to make a collection of (free) books covering the topics up to pre-calculus level.
- Any feedback on the books content is always welcome
- Polishing the English version. I have read my fair share of English books on math but have never lived in an English-speaking country. I really hope the English version is already at an acceptable level language-wise but it would be great if someone could wash out potential hints of Norwegian in the text.
- Translating the book into other languages
