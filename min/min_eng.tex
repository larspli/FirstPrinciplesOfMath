\subsection*{Subtraction with amounts}
When removing a part of an amount, we use the symbol \sym{$ - $}:
\[ 5-{\color{red} 3}=2 \]
\fig{min1c}

\spr{
A calculation involving subtraction includes one or more \textit{terms}\index{term} and one \textit{difference}\index{difference}. In the calculation
\[  5-3=2 \] 
both $ 5 $ and $ 3 $ are terms while $ 2 $ is the difference. \vsk

Common ways of saying $ 5-3 $ include
\begin{itemize}
	\item ''5 minus 3'' \\
	\item ''3 subtracted from 5''
\end{itemize}
} \vsk \vsk

\info{A new interpretation of 0}{
As mentioned earlier in this book, 0 can be interpreted as ''nothing''. However, subtraction brings the possibility of expressing 0 by other numbers, for example $ {7-7=0} $ and $ {19-19=0} $. In many practical situations, 0 indicates some form of equilibrium, like two equal but opposite forces.

\subsection*{Subtraction on the number line: Moving to the left}
In \refsec{Addisjon}, we have seen that \sym{$ + $} (with positive numbers) involves moving  \textsl{to the right} on the number line. With \sym{$ - $} it's the opposite, we move \textsl{to the left}\footnote{In figures with number lines, the red colored arrows indicates that you shall start at the arrowhead and move to the other end.}: \regv

\[ 6-4=2 \]

}
\eks[2]{ \vs
	\[ 12-7=5 \]

}
\info{Notice}{
At first it may seem a bit odd moving in the opposite direction of the way in which the arrows point, as in \textsl{Example 1} and \textsl{2}. However, in \refkap{Negtal} this will turn out to be useful.
